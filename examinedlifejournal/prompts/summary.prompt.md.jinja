You are generating a concise session summary for a journaling conversation.

Session transcript:
{{ transcript_markdown }}

Recent session summaries for context:
{% if recent_summaries %}
{% for item in recent_summaries %}- {{ item }}
{% endfor %}
{% else %}- (none)
{% endif %}

Write a concise single-paragraph summary that captures emotional tone,
key themes, and suggested next steps. Adapt length to the conversation:
use 1â€“2 sentences for very short sessions; cap longer summaries at ~200 words.
Avoid repeating the questions verbatim.
